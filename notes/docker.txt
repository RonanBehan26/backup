Docker

consistently building, running and shipping apps

container - isolated environment for running an app. the Containers can run side by side on the same machine,
 but with different configs and dependencies
- can just remove a container nb
- dont have to spend a lot of time setting up a machine
- just tell docker to bring it up - and it will bring up different configs and dependencies on isolated containers

VM - abstraction of a physical machine

the alternative is resource + time  extensive

Containers 
- allow running of different apps in isolation
- lightweight
- use OS of the host - use the kernel(like the core of the OS-manages all apps), this is why we can't run other apps on other OS
- start quickly
- need less hardware resources

its a client server architecture, uses rest apis

how to start - dockerise the app 
- how - add the dockerfile - this helps package it into an image, then put that image into the container
- docker run inside the container
- dockerhub is like github (registry)
